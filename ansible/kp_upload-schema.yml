  # The vars: section is added for the below reason
  # 1. Introduce a common variable for various clouds. In case of azure, it refers to container name, in case of aws / gcp, it refers to folder name
  # 2. We want to avoid too many new variable introduction / replacement in first phase. Hence we will reuse the existing variable defined in private repo
  #    or other default files and just assign the value to the newly introduced common variable 
  # 3. After few releases, we will remove the older variables and use only the new variables across the repos
