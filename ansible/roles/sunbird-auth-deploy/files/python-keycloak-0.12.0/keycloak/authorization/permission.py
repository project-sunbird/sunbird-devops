class Permission:
    """
    Consider this simple and very common permission:

    A permission associates the object being protected with the policies that must be evaluated to determine whether access is granted.

    X CAN DO Y ON RESOURCE Z

    where â€¦
        X represents one or more users, roles, or groups, or a combination of them. You can
        also use claims and context here.
        Y represents an action to be performed, for example, write, view, and so on.
        Z represents a protected resource, for example, "/accounts".
